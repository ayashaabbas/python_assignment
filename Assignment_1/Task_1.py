Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
'''
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.

a=int(input("Enter The fist number :"))
b=int(input("Enter The Second number :"))

#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on thes:e two numbers:

sub= a -b
mul= a*b
div=a/b

#3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

print("Addition :{} ".format(add))
